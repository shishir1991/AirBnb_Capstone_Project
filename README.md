## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can suggest appropriate listing prices to property owners when they list their properties for rent on Airbnb. The dataset used for this project includes various attributes of the Calender, listings, hosts, and reviews.

## Data Description

The dataset comprises four tables:

1. **Calendar**: Contains information about listing availability and pricing over time.
2. **Listings**: Includes detailed information about each property listing.
3. **Hosts**: Contains information about the hosts who have posted the listings.
4. **Reviews**: Includes reviews left by guests who have stayed at the properties.
